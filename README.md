# Sketch2Spec

Sketch2Spec is an AI-powered design-to-code assistant that helps developers and designers transform hand-drawn wireframes and UI sketches into production-ready React components. It handles everything from real-time image analysis using vision AI, generating clean JSX code with Tailwind CSS, providing live component previews, and offering instant code regeneration for iterative refinement.

## Problem We Aim to Solve

The design-to-development handoff is slow and inefficient. As developers, we've all been through the cycle of manually translating mockups into code, guessing at spacing and colors, writing repetitive component structures, and hoping the result matches the design. Most of the time, there's back-and-forth with designers, no clear starting point, and hours spent on boilerplate. Sketch2Spec was built to fix that - by helping you convert any wireframe or UI screenshot into working React code instantly, preview it across devices, and iterate quickly until it's perfect.

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Code Generation

Sketch2Spec uses Google Gemini's vision models to analyze your wireframes and UI screenshots in real-time. Simply upload an image, and it generates complete React components with Tailwind CSS styling. You can choose between two models:

- **Gemini Flash (Optimized)**: Faster generation, ideal for simple to medium complexity UIs
- **Gemini Pro (Precision)**: Higher detail analysis, perfect for complex layouts and intricate designs

The AI extracts layout hierarchies, identifies UI elements, matches colors and typography, and produces clean, semantic JSX code ready to use in your projects.

### Smart Code Sanitization & Optimization

Sketch2Spec analyzes the generated code to:

- Remove TypeScript syntax for browser compatibility
- Convert ES6 imports to UMD globals for iframe rendering
- Auto-detect and import Lucide React icons used in the JSX
- Validate code completeness and syntax correctness
- Apply retry logic with exponential backoff for robust generation
- Ensure balanced braces, proper exports, and complete component structures

### Live Component Preview

You can preview your generated components instantly in a sandboxed iframe environment. The preview system supports:

- **Responsive Device Switching**: Test across desktop (100%), tablet (768px), and mobile (375px) viewports
- **Real-time Rendering**: See changes immediately with hot-reloading
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages with stack traces for debugging
- **Code Inspection**: Side-by-side view of source code and live preview
- **One-Click Copy**: Copy the entire JSX code to your clipboard instantly

### Iterative Regeneration

Sketch2Spec lets you regenerate code directly from the preview page without re-uploading your image. This enables rapid iteration:

- Refine the generated output with a single click
- Get variations of the same design
- Experiment with different AI interpretations
- Save time during the design-to-code workflow

All generated code is stored in session storage, so you can navigate between pages without losing your work.

### Secure Image Management

Upload your wireframes securely through Cloudinary integration:

- Signed upload URLs prevent unauthorized access
- Support for PNG, JPG, JPEG, and WebP formats
- Automatic image optimization and CDN delivery
- Persistent storage with unique public IDs
- Direct integration with AI generation pipeline

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Sign up or log in** using Clerk authentication
2. **Navigate to the Dashboard** after authentication
3. **Upload your wireframe** by clicking "Browse Files" or drag-and-drop
4. **Select an AI model** (Optimized for speed, Precision for detail)
5. **Click "Generate Component"** and wait 5-15 seconds
6. **View the live preview** with responsive device switching
7. **Copy the code** to your clipboard with one click
8. **Regenerate if needed** for variations or improvements

### Tips for Best Results

- Use high-contrast, well-lit photos of your sketches
- Start with simpler layouts for better accuracy
- Add labels or annotations to wireframes for context
- Use the Precision model for complex, multi-section layouts
- Iterate with regeneration to explore different interpretations

## API Endpoints

### `POST /api/ai/generate`

Generate React code from a wireframe image URL.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "imageUrl": "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
  "model": "gemini-flash-latest",
  "allowFallback": false
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "code": "import React from 'react'...",
  "provider": "Gemini",
  "fallbackUsed": false
}
```

### `POST /api/cloudinary/sign`

Generate a signed upload URL for Cloudinary.

**Request:**
```json

```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "signature": "...",
  "timestamp": 1234567890,
  "api_key": "...",
  "cloud_name": "..."
}
```

## Configuration

### AI Model Settings

Adjust generation parameters in `lib/aiProviders.ts`:

```typescript
generationConfig: {
  temperature: 0.2,        // Lower = more deterministic
  maxOutputTokens: 16000,  // Maximum code length
  topP: 0.95,
  topK: 40,
}
```

### Preview Customization

Modify the preview environment in `lib/buildPreviewSrcDoc.ts`:

- React version: `react@18`
- Tailwind CDN: `cdn.tailwindcss.com`
- Lucide icons: `lucide-react@0.474.0`
- Babel: `@babel/standalone@7.23.5`
